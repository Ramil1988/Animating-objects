# Animating-objects
Some code for animating objects

There are several animations with the items: 

  1. Change the background color of the square to yellow.
  2. Move to the top right corner of the screen.
  3. Round the edges to make the square look like a circle.
  4. Rotate 180 degrees.
  5. "Disappear".
  6. First zoomed in twice, then animate zoomed back out.
  7. Endless rotation animation.
